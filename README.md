# REACH2018
<br>
Welcome! This skeleton code is to help you get started on the code to capture images using picamera and detect if there is trash in those images. 

## Getting started
<br>
In your terminal type: git clone https://github.com/etapiahe/REACH2018.git

## Running the program
<br>
In your terminal type: python process_image.py
<br>It is recommended you use python 2.7

## Imports
<br>
The next step is to get the imports working. If you get an error, odds are if you google it, it will tell you which command to install the missing library

## TODO:
<br>
I provided hints on how I was able to get it working but feel free to change it up. Use this as a stepping stone. 
<br>
<br>
Feel free to use Google's Computer Vision API, TensorFlow, or any other API to perform object detection in the image.
